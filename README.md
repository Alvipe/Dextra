# TYR
Printable robotic hand prosthesis

# Description
The Transradial mYoelectric pRosthesis (TYR) is a printable robotic hand with the size of a human hand. This hand is intended to be a low cost alternative to current robotic hand prostheses. The desing of the hand is based on the finger module, a modular part that comprises an underactuated robotic finger and a tendon winder, which is a compact linear actuator based on a Pololu micro metal gearmotor. Almost all the mechanical parts are 3D printable.
