The Dextra Control GUI is designed using [Kivy](https://kivy.org/#home). Besides having Python installed, this library and its dependencies are required to run the application. The application uses both the *.py* and the *.kv* files, and they need to be in the same folder.

To run the control GUI, connect the microcontroller running the Dextra firmware to a USB port of the computer, and run:

```bash
~/Dextra$ cd Control
~/Dextra/Control$ python DextraControl.py
```
